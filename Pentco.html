            <strong><u>Situation:</u></strong>
        </h5>
        <p>
            A job has some parts that have to be sent to Pentco for finishing. These parts have to be sent out before the rest of the job is started (Production start) finished correctly, on all the correct areas, and back here in time to meet up with the rest of
            the order that didn’t have to go to Pentco.
        </p>
        <h5>
            <strong><u>Goal:</u></strong>
        </h5>
        <p>
            How to get a job being sent to Pentco finished correctly, on all the correct areas, and back here in time to meet up with the rest of the order that didn’t have to go to Pentco.

            <li>
                <p>
                    Will create an individual order with a ship list for Pentco items.

            <li>
                <p>
                    This individual order will have its own Production start, Production end and ship date, with the goal being that Pentco completes the order and we receive it just before the original Jobs Production End date minus 4 days.

                <p>
                    What this really means and what typically happens, because of Pentcos 3 – 4 week lead time, when an order is being preordered in Engineering, the Pentco section essentially becomes a pink sheet with:
