            Note that the difference between the thickness of the CC and the PL can be a lot in our kitchen cabinet world.

                Usually this won’t be an issue but the challenges are:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    When building a cabinet out of these materials, we have to pre-confirm the thickness so we can make ensure that the final
                    cabinet width is correct.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If an order is mixing plywood core and composite core EP’s thicknesses may vary too much for some applications.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If an order is using plywood core EP’s and then has 1 longer than 8’ (plywood max length is 8’) and it must be composite
                    core, thicknesses may vary too much for some applications.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A composite core EP beside a plywood core EP may be noticeable if the thicknesses are different.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If an order has plywood core material that varies too much for one sheet to another, this may be too much for some applications.
                </li>
            </ol>
