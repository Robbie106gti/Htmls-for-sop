                You are all done.

                Note that this is the intermediate way of calibrating the unit; normally it is done with the CALIBRATE button at the bottom
                of the front panel. If both of the above do not work, read below (in blue) FIRST-if that doesn't do the trick,
                then you can do a "hard reset" by powering the unit down, holding the PAUSE and the FEED button at the same
                time, and while holding them down, turning back on the power. This should only be used as a last resort,
                however, because it resets everything to factory settings. (NOT a good thing!)
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    Please be advised that if the intermediate calibration does not correct the issue, then you should use a bottle of 92% rubbing
                    alcohol/Isopropyl alcohol (you can buy at CVS or any pharmacy for less than 2 dollars) and cotton swabs
                    to clean both the top sensor and the bottom sensor-make sure to turn off the power FIRST, and make sure
                    to allow a minute or so for the alcohol to dry after doing the cleaning. The combination of cleaning
                    the sensor and doing the intermediate calibration procedure is about 95% effective.
