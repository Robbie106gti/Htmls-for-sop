            B will:
        </p>
        <p>
            1. The shelf parts are optimized with the PA parts. They are cut on the panel saw, machined on the Nesting machine and glued
            together on the press.
        </p>
        <p>
            2. P2P operator machining the shelf. Ensure that the height of the final opening for the supports is exactly:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                14mm when the SHFS is &lt; 12 ½” deep (for the shorter support).
            </li>
            <li>
                16mm when the SHFS is &gt; 12 ½” deep (for the longer support).
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This is so the support will fit, but not too loosely. It may vary because of our different material thicknesses.
        </p>
        <p>
            3. Glue the shelf together and tape edge if required.

            PA will:
        </p>
        <p>
            1. Cut the rail to… Length = “opening in the back of the floating shelf” - 1”
        </p>
        <p>
            2. Attach support to rail in shop.
        </p>
        <p>
            3. Insert the supports into the shelf and tape it into position for delivery.
        </p>
        <p>
            4. Supply 1 stud screw and 1 wall anchor for each support and bag these items marking the bag with the item number.

            Install the rail to the wall using the supplied screws and attaching the rail to studs or to the supplied drywall anchors.
        </p>
        <p>
            We recommend you install the supports as close to the studs as possible to reduce flex/sag.
        </p>
        <p>
            We recommend you adjust the supports so the angle is aiming up as much as possible. This will aid in compensating for any
            heavier objects added onto the shelf in the future and long term sag.

            Loosen the set screw at the bottom of the support and use a wrench or your hand to turn the support bar to the appropriate
            angle. Re-tighten the set screw on the bottom of the support when done adjusting the angle of the support bar.
        </p>
        <p>
            Slide the shelf into position. It is recommended that you add a bead of silicone onto the supports to hold the shelf into
            position.
