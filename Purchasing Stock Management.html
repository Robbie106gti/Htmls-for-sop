                            add onto it all items that are still usable but not on the list

            <u>Purchasing items with an order tag. </u>
        </h4>
        <p>
            Put the appropriate Tag in the “In” Order box, in the Purchasing office. All standard stock items should make it into the
            shop in 3 working days, except cardboard, 1” plastic spacers and Blum Canada take 5 days. If it is a rush and
            is expected quicker then this, give the tag to the Purchaser directly and tell him when you need it. Submitting
            tags to Purchasing should only be done by Lead hands or Team Leaders. The Purchaser will put the tag in the “Out”
            box after ordering. These can be picked up after the item arrives.

            Use one of the generic Pink slips in the Purchasing office and leave it in the “In” Order box (give to Purchaser directly
            if it is a rush). Whenever possible, give Purchasing the order code. The Purchaser will put the tag in the “Out”
            box after ordering. These can be picked up after the item arrives.

                Any items in your Teams area that you aren’t using should be returned to the supplier. If that isn’t possible, put them in

            <li>
                Any items in your Teams area that you aren’t using but you think you might, should be Blue Tagged and put in the Craig’s
                list zone so it can be reviewed in a year.

            When purchasing custom stains and paints, order the item and give The Purchaser the PO from your PO book. The supplier is
            to fax P a price.

            If for whatever reason, a custom order, or a stock item becomes unusable, it should be brought to Jason’s office or, if it’s
            to big, be brought to his attention with an email so he can send it back. If for some reason it can’t be sent
            back, Jason will track it to use it in the future or we will sell it ASAP on Craigs list.

                Keep our “cash sitting around” to as small an amount as possible.

            <li>
                Some items get to old to use. Out of style or unusable.

            <li>
                Keep required storage space down.

                Use the first in, first out mode so we can track supplier/item quality and style. CONSISTENCY.

                If we decide to stop using something, we don’t want a large supply remaining (yellow gloves).

                Bifold door hardware. We actually had it in stock, but dispersed throughout the shop.

                Book keeping needs to know so we can properly balance the books and actually know we aren’t getting overcharged.
