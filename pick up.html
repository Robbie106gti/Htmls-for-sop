            <li>
                Purchasing will do all standard pick ups when possible.
            </li>
            <li>
                Shipping, Service and Finishing will tell Purchasing when they are on the road so they can do pick ups when appropriate.
            </li>
            <li>
                Shipping, Finishing, Doors and Maintenance will notify Purchasing if they need something picked up or dropped off.
            </li>
            <li>
                Finishing will notify Purchasing when Finishing has to do a special pick up so they can pick up or drop off others if appropriate.
            </li>
            <li>
                All teams will notify Purchasing if they have an errand that needs to be done, to see if it fits into his pick up schedule.
            </li>
            <li>
                Acroma will call Purchasing when they have a pick up. Finishing will put a note on their PO to Acroma to tell them to do
                this.
            </li>
            <li>
                If a pick up is a rush, Purchasing needs to know the
                <u>exact time</u> it is required by.

        <ul>
            <li>
                If you’re picking up at Richelieu, you need an order number. Call Richelieu 1 hour ahead so they can have it ready.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make sure that the packing list matches what you’re picking up and that it has been fulfilled.
            </li>
            <li>
                If an item is not there, ready or incorrect, please call purchasing before leaving the supplier to see if the problem can
                be rectified before you leave.
            </li>
            <li>
                Leave the picked up items in one of the specific receiving areas.
            </li>
            <li>
                Give Purchasing the packing list.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you don’t receive a packing list, Purchasing must be told.
            </li>
            <li>
                If there is only a receipt for an item only ordered once, give this receipt to Accounting. Purchasing doesn’t need to get
                involved with these items.
