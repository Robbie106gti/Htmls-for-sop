        <p>
            All Credits requested from our suppliers must go through purchasing. Purchasing needs to manage the paperwork so we know that it actually happens and that
            <strong>our suppliers are kept accountable.</strong> Please make sure that Purchasing is informed of all requested credits so that he can apply the paperwork to the situation. Book keeping will let Purchasing know if the credit does or doesn't
            go through.

                    <i>What to do when a dealer says a situation is a</i> warranty:</u>
            </strong>
        </h6>
        <p>
            Just replace the item ASAP at our charge.
            <br> If it is an error that we feel that we could have caught in the OE office, split the cost.
            <br> If we believe something was damaged in shipping but left here in good condition, replace ASAP at our charge but check the POD with Book keeping and fax to them explaining what we expect. For points 1 through 3, please ask them if they
            can get the installer to take a picture of the infraction when he returns to the site with the replacement (so we can learn and improve from the scenario). Only ask for this if the item costs a lot.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are unsure of the situation, use the following steps:
            <ul>
                <li>Ask for a picture via email.</li>
                <li>Evaluate with the appropriate people if need be. If the dealer disagrees with our decision, have them call the Dealer Rep. about the problem. </li>
                <li>The Dealer Rep. can call Dave if he also disagrees.</li>
                <li>Inform Dave about a situation coming down the pipe.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            All of the previous is to be saturated with liquid common sense and if there is any doubt, ask and discuss. If we can't come up with a solution within the OE TEAM, we will ask Ted and/or Dave. If you are unsure, ask.

                <u>Some new policies for Warranties (July 2016):</u>
            </strong>
        </h6>
        <p>
            1. Please be careful when labelling the job in the Customer Information (Warranty-Nickels, Warranty-Supplier, etc). We are trying to get more accurate numbers for these jobs and once they reach Invoice we can't change the label.
        </p>
        <p>
            2. When we have to do a replacement or refinish for a Wood Doors and Drawers we MUST have the adjacent door/drawer to use as a control sample. It just doesn't work using our control sample alone and we end up having costly redos. Of course there may be
            exceptions but as a general rule we require the onsite control sample. If we do not have an onsite sample, then we will have to inform the dealer they will get as close as we can get.
        </p>
        <p>
            3. Warranty Incident Reports: Order Desk we fill out an incident report for Nickels Warranties and Goodwill that will be placed in the Docs of the job and in a binder in OE. The report will indicate what the issue is, how it was investigated, what the
            resolution is and who approved the warranty.
        </p>
        <p>
            4. Order Desk will now add proper $ amounts to Warranty jobs so we can track how much money the warranty cost.
        </p>
        <p>
            5. Warranty credits should not be included in the line items of the job. The credit should be added to the line after the Delivery charges so that the Job Total is accurate and the Dealer Total = $0.
        </p>
        <p>
            6. Order Desk will create a separate order for Warranty jobs, if there are extra parts included in the order that are additions and not warranty items.
        </p>
        <p>
            7. Megan will add Dennis' time to the Service Calls using the CC-LBR charge and then credit out the amount so the Dealer Total = $0. If Dennis' time is billable (as in the issue is the dealer's responsibility and we are providing Dennis as a service)
            Order Desk will add the billable labour to the job before it is confirmed.
