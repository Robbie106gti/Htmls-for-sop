                Note that the
                <strong>METRO-ALBR</strong> and the
                <strong>METRO-ALMAT</strong> need custom machining on the sides. The door company we buy these from will do it for
                us as long as we tell them about it.

                The gables are to be predrilled.

                The adjustable shelf maximum depth should be the cabinet depth minus 56mm.

                Engineering should use the blum Dynalog program to find what items are required for your situation.

                Note that the arm lengths differ for different cabinet heights. Below is a chart defining which arm is used when. This will
                only get confusing if there are more than 1 size ordered for the same job. If in doubt, ask engineering which
                arm is for which cabinet. If there is more than 1 length of lever arm on the same job, the engineer should
                note which is for which cabinet on the job.
