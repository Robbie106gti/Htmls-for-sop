            <strong>PPP = Payment Prior to Production:</strong>
        </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                When an order with PPP status is sent to scheduling, the O (Optimizing) and S (Shipping) column automatically become marked
                red (on hold) and an email is sent to the dealer notifying them to send a cheque for 50% of the total value
                before the order will be actually scheduled and sent to engineering for further processing.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Production Manager has the ability to override PPP rules and convert them to PPS rules on a “Fix up” order that is &lt;
                $500.
            </li>
            <li>
                Whomever receives the cheque will change the O column tracking status to “Not Done” and also note the cheque number and the
                date in the tracking status.
            </li>
            <li>
                Two weeks before the ship date, Accounting sends an email to the Dealer notifying them of the remaining payment that is required
                the day prior to the ship date.
            </li>
            <li>
                One week before the ship date, unless the payment has arrived, Accounting sends an email to the Dealer, Order Desk, Shipping,
                Designer Relations and to the Production Manager notifying them of the remaining payment that is required
                the day prior to the ship date.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the cheque arrives on the same day as the delivery, whomever receives the cheque should call/page Shipping ASAP and tell
                them that the cheque has arrived. It is to be assumed that the cheque will clear.
            </li>
            <li>
                Whomever receives the cheque will change the S column tracking status to “Not Done” and also note the cheque number and the
                date in the tracking status.
