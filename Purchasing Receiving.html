        <ul>
            <li>
                The first team head that sees a deliverer waiting, should:
            </li>
            <li>
                Approach him with a smile and ask him if he has been helped.
            </li>
            <li>
                Check that the correct amount of packages have arrived according to his paperwork.
            </li>
            <li>
                Ensure that the package isn’t damaged. If it is, you need to note that on the receiving work and you and the deliverer need
                to sign it.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the Receiver is unavailable but is IN (See the Receiver sign):

                    <li>
                        Leave the item on the Receivers table along with the paperwork.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Notify the appropriate team head if it is material that needs to be unloaded with a forklift.

                    <li>
                        Deliver the item to the appropriate team head and leave the paperwork on the Receivers desk. The Team head should confirm,
                        after opening the package, that type, quantity etc. are correct. DWD moulding and large Blum hardware
                        orders are exceptions and must be left for the receiver to check off. If any items are taken from
                        1 of these exceptions before Receiving has checked them off, leave a note stating this.

                    <li>

        <p>
            There is a portion of the items in the Purchasing Stock zone that are not inventory items but are there because of past overstocking
            or an ordering error. All of these items that end up here will also be added into purchasing plus so that we
            will be warned that there is one in stock. Note that some of these items have been put on a pallet and moved
            onto the rack above the receiving bench.
