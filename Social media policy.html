            <strong>Overview</strong>
        </h5>
        <p>
            This policy governs the publication of and commentary on social media by employees of Nickels Cabinets and its related companies
            ("Nickels Cabinets"). For the purposes of this policy, social media means any facility for online publication
            and commentary, including without limitation blogs, wiki's, social networking sites such as Facebook, LinkedIn,
            Twitter, Flickr, and YouTube. This policy is in addition to and complements any existing or future policies regarding
            the use of technology, computers, e-mail and the internet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nickels Cabinets employees who are not part of the social media team are not allowed to publish or comment via social media
            in any way that suggests they are doing so in connection with Nickels Cabinets. Nickels Cabinets employees who
            are part of the social media team are free to publish or comment via social media in accordance with this policy.
            Such employees are subject to this policy to the extent they identify themselves as a Nickels Cabinets employee
            (other than as an incidental mention of place of employment in a personal social media on topics unrelated to
            Nickels Cabinets).
        </p>
        <p>
            Publication and commentary on social media carries similar obligations to any other kind of publication or commentary.
        </p>
        <p>
            All uses of social media must follow the same ethical standards that Nickels Cabinets employees must otherwise follow.

            </h6>
            <p>
                It's perfectly acceptable to talk about your work and have a dialog with the community, but it's not okay to publish confidential
                information. Confidential information includes things such as unpublished details about our software, details
                of current projects, future product ship dates, financial information, research, and trade secrets. We must
                respect the wishes of our corporate customers regarding the confidentiality of current projects. We must
                also be mindful of the competitiveness of our industry.

                Be Honest
            </h6>
            <p>
                Do not blog anonymously, using pseudonyms or false screen names. We believe in transparency and honesty. Use your real name,
                be clear who you are, and identify that you work for Nickels Cabinets. Nothing gains you notice in social
                media more than honesty - or dishonesty. Do not say anything that is dishonest, untrue, or misleading. If
                you have a vested interest in something you are discussing, point it out. But also be smart about protecting
                yourself and your privacy. What you publish will be around for a long time, so consider the content carefully
                and also be cautious about disclosing personal details.

                Respect copyright laws
            </h6>
            <p>
                It is critical that you show proper respect for the laws governing copyright and fair use or fair dealing of copyrighted
                material owned by others; including Nickels Cabinets own copyrights and brands. You should never quote more
                than short excerpts of someone else's work, and always attribute such work to the original author/source.
                It is good general practice to link to others' work rather than reproduce it.

                Respect your audience, Nickels Cabinets, and your coworkers
            </h6>
            <p>
                The public in general, and Nickels Cabinets employees and customers, reflect a diverse set of customs, values and points
                of view. Don't say anything contradictory or in conflict with the Nickels Cabinets website. Don't be afraid
                to be yourself, but do so respectfully. This includes not only the obvious (no ethnic slurs, offensive comments,
                defamatory comments, personal insults, obscenity, etc.) but also proper consideration of privacy and of topics
                that may be considered objectionable or inflammatory - such as politics and religion. Use your best judgment
                and be sure to make it clear that the views and opinions expressed are yours alone and do not represent the
                official views of Nickels Cabinets.

                Protect Nickels Cabinets customers, business partners and suppliers
            </h6>
            <p>
                Customers, partners or suppliers should not be cited or obviously referenced without their approval. Never identify a customer,
                partner or supplier by name without permission and never discuss confidential details of a customer engagement.
                It is acceptable to discuss general details about kinds of projects and to use non-identifying pseudonyms
                for a customer (e.g., Customer 123) so long as the information provided does not violate any non-disclosure
                agreements that may be in place with the customer or make it easy for someone to identify the customer. Your
                blog is not the place to "conduct business" with a customer.

                Controversial Issues
            </h6>
            <p>
                If you see misrepresentations made about Nickels Cabinets in the media, you may point that out. Always do so with respect
                and with the facts. If you speak about others, make sure what you say is factual and that it does not disparage
                that party. Avoid arguments. Brawls may earn traffic, but nobody wins in the end. Don't try to settle scores
                or goad competitors or others into inflammatory debates. Make sure what you are saying is factually correct.

                Disclaimers
            </h6>
            <p>
                Many social media users include a prominent disclaimer saying who they work for, but that they're not speaking officially.
                This is good practice and is encouraged, but don't count on it to avoid trouble - it may not have much legal
                effect.
            </p>
            <p>
                The social media team can provide you with applicable disclaimer language and assist with determining where and how to use
                that.

                Policy violations will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination for cause.
