                If engineering has started working on the order (eg. Preordering is complete) the “change of order fee” should be added along
                with the standard shop hourly rate for every hour required to make the change. This is on top of the cost
                of any items/changes they are adding/making to the order. A discussion with all involved, to determine the
                time needed, is required.
