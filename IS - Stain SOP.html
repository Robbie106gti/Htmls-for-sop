                for 1 liter of stain, the labels should say
                <strong>
                    <u>½ liter toner</u>

                This is typically used when a customer wants a more durable finish then our std. on a wood countertop. We won’t do the finish
                because they typically want this scenario with a sink cutout in it which means splashing water, which means
                we don’t want to get into the warranty issues of future water damage. With some of our stains this is no
                issue, but with some (Copper, Bronze, Autumn, Chocolate, Nutbrown and some custom colors that will have to
                individually researched) the finish they apply may react with unknown results to our stain. This is because
                our 2 step stain process for the listed stains that includes a “stain in lacquer” as step 2. Our solution
                to this is that we can stain the counter for the customer and prep it for finishing and we recommend they
                use a Plastofix finish. Available at Chemcraft, the product code is 488-0XX. For more details of this product,
                contact Paint or OE.
