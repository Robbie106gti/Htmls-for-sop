                <strong>Maintaining the program files for Rover A.</strong> File names for rover A are unique. They are organized
                in folders with batch name. The CNC operator downloads one batch at the time. If programs for more than one
                month get together in folder with same name the excess of files’ quantity will slow down the computer on
                Rover A. Delete the folders with the programs for Rover A following the same rule as the programs for Rover
                B. Twice a month (before you start working on batch that number is higher than 15 or is for the next month)
                delete the files that are for batches 1 to 15 (when you start a new month) or batches from 16 to 31 when

                <strong>Maintaining the label files for Rover A.</strong> The label files for rover A have extension “MDB”. Each
                file represents a batch. Each batch file contains database of label information organized in tables by material
                and date. It is possible the files for more than two months to merge and become too oversized and the list
                with materials might confuse the CNC operator. At the end of each month (before a batch for the next month
                have been started) the Rover A label files that are located on the CADCode computer have to be moved to a
                separate folder. They are located on:
                <br>C:\CADCode\Label Data</p>
            <p>In that folder select create a new subfolder with name format as “YYYY.MM” and move there all folders for the
