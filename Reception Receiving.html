        </h1>
        <ul>
            <li>
                No inventory or repair items piling up in the showroom.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Whenever possible, reception should send all delivery people to our receiving team. Note that there is yellow sign by the
            receiving door.
        </p>
        <p>
            These are the steps we will follow when items are received by our receptionist.
