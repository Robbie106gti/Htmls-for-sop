                All shipped orders are sent to “shipped” box in webquoin for invoicing. A copy of the dealer’s summary is submitted to accounting
                (Miyuki).

                All finished orders that were delayed by dealers are sent to “shipped” box. A copy of the dealer’s summary is submitted to
                accounting (Miyuki), with a note attached to send to “invoiced but not shipped” box. These orders will be
                invoiced and then shipped at a later date.

                All remaining orders in production and engineering are assessed for W.I.P. The total W.I.P. is reported to the accounting
                team and is recorded in the proper wage/sales cell (Ted will do this). p> 3.1 How to calculate W.I.P.

                    Ensure all team leaders are notified to update the job tracking report at the end of the last day of the month. Using the
                    job tracking report (print a copy from engineering as well as production for all applicable dates), calculate
                    the value of each individual job (rounded to the nearest $100.00) not including taxes. Use the totals
                    on the screen for this step. Use a percentage applied to each process as the tool to assess value.

                        D = 10%

                    <li>
                        DA = 10%

                    <li>
                        F = 20%

                        A = 10%
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    If the order in tracking is yellow or blue, add ½ the applicable percentage. The maximum value for W.I.P. should be 90% of
                    total job value (not including taxes). This allows the rest to be considered as “profit”.
