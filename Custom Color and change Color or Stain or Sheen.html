                        Whenever a customer wants to match any color (i. e. from a fan deck, from a site sample, etc…), order desk needs to make sure we don’t have the color in our catalogue before creating a new custom number. If it is an existing color, painted more than one
                        year ago, there is no need to order a color match, but just a freshly painted set of sample blocks;

                    <p>
                        Any color discontinuation, deletion or cancellation means that the color cannot be ordered for future jobs, even if the job is an extension of an old job finished with a color within the old number system.

                        Even though we will be discontinuing colors we should keep files for all of them with the color number, the code / recipe from the supplier and the color description (job number, customer / dealer’s name, date off order and whatever we consider relevant)
