            Follow these five steps to lock out permanently connected or hard-wired machinery or equipment:
        </h6>
        <ol>
            <li>Identify the machinery or equipment that needs to be locked up.</li>
            <li>Shut off the machine and make sure that all moving parts have come to a complete stop.</li>
            <li>Find the electrical and air source and disconnect the machine from the power supply.</li>
            <li>Apply a personal lock to the energy-isolating device, if required. After disconnecting the machine from every source, apply a personal lock.</li>
            <li>After ensuring that all workers are in the clear, test the lockout to make sure it's effective.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Test the lockout by pressing the start button</p>

            <u>Electrical equipment that is plugged in (Jigsaw etc.):</u>
        </h5>
        <h6>
            Follow these steps to lock out plugged-in machinery and equipment:
        </h6>
        <ol>
            <li>Identify the machinery or equipment that needs to be locked up.</li>
            <li>Shut off the machine or equipment and make sure that all moving parts have come to a complete stop.</li>
            <li>Unplug the machine.</li>
            <li>Apply a personal lock to the plug unless the worker doing the maintenance can keep the plug in view and under control while working on the equipment.</li>
            <li>Test the lockout to make sure it's effective.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><i>Pull the plug to disconnect the machine from the electric power supply.</i></p>
        <h6>Lockout</h6>
        <p>In step 4, if the plug is kept under the exclusive and immediate control of one worker at all times while the maintenance work is being done, then a lock may not be required. The worker should have the plug in sight and within reach so that no
            one else can accidentally plug in the equipment. However, if the worker leaves the equipment unattended without a lock and the work, then the lockout procedure must be re-established when the worker returns. Alternatively, the worker can apply
            a lock when leaving the equipment.</p>

            <li>- Shut off the Jigsaw</li>
            <li>- Unplug the Jigsaw</li>
            <li>- Keep the plug in plain view and within reach while performing maintenance on the Jigsaw</li>
