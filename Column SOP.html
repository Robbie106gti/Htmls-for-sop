            In Quoin, columns are now priced as and treated like a cabinet. FE’s will have to be specified.
        </p>
        <p>
            PA will now be assembling them like a cabinet.
        </p>
        <p>
            The column parts will be brought from BO with dowels and drilling in them to be assembled and clamped by PA.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Column face will be attached to the column cabinet with glue, tape and toe-nailed pins.

            Notes:
        </h5>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    When a column is being used in a Wall application, we will treat it as a plant on (like AD’s, AG’s, EP’s etc.) and finish
                    the top and bottom to match the exterior material as opposed to matching the bottom of the wall cabinets.
                    The grain will run in the direction of the depth.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The minimum column depth will now be 6”.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    6” deep columns. Because the pieces get to small for the dowel inserter, the top, bottom and fixed shelves will be precut
                    1” longer. PA will cut them to the correct size before assembly.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    If a column is requested to be finished on the back, this means the back will be veneered.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    If a column is requested to be a peninsula column, it will receive an attached face as the front (it will be proud also).
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    There will be a V joint/broken edges between the column cabinet and the attached column front.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Columns that are higher then 43” will be clamped in the case clamp in FA because the case clamp in PA is to small.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Full height columns have 1/2” of scribe at the bottom. This means that if a BFh65 column is ordered, we will send a 35” high
                    column that is meant to line up beside a 30” high base with a 4 ½” high kick. The excess 1/2” at the
                    bottom is designed to be for on site scribing.
                </p>

            <li>
                <p>
                    With the 261 column, we will fill in behind the moulding with a piece of 1/8” thick material. There will be a visible joint
                    on the side because there is a plant-on face. The cutout in the plant-on face should be made on the table
                    saw for the length and use a jigsaw for the width cuts.
                </p>

            <li>
                <p>
                    With the 301 column, we will fill in behind the moulding with a piece of 1/8” thick material. There will be a visible joint
                    on the side because there is a plant-on face. The Stiles and rails should be made out of solid material.
                </p>

                    When angled, column 261 and 301 will follow the construction style of CLM 101 – 251.

                <p>
                    With 320 and 330 columns, we will be veneering the front. There will be no visible joint on the side because there is no
                    plant-on face.
                </p>

                <p>
                    With the 400 series of columns, we will be taping the front edge of the column gables. The will visible joint on the side
                    will be by the corner blocks only.
