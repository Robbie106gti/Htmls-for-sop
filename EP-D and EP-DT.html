                    Potential item to add into Quoin: It seems that a certain dealers (Westwerk and Urbana) are ordering these on a semi regular
                    basis and it is a little cumbersome (entering and reading and re-reading).

        <p>
            An FP gets a like sized door attached to it and all edges are veneered to make it look like one piece. An EP the size of
            the requested mock toekick is then biscuited onto the bottom with broken edges on the joint between the mock
            toekick and the EP-D.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>

                <p>
                    The joint between the EP-D and the mock toe kick isn’t dowelled, it’s biscuited. There is no gap between the pieces but they
                    have broken edges on the joint so the seam is visible.
