            Dennis installed the one displayed in these images.
            <br> He followed the instructions supplied with the hardware.
            <br> Jig created by Dennis to drill the 12mm deep holes for the Servo drive switches. This hole ends up being higher
            then they recommend but with no negative effects. He made the hole higher because he needed the space for the
            drill he was using to fit comfortably.
