        <p>
            Preset shelf lengths and drilling.
            <br> The length options are from 10” to 96”.
            <br> The depth options are a minimum of 8” to a maximum of 10”. A depth of 12” is acceptable if one of the ends is
            fixed to a cabinet. Note that we don’t prep the ends for supports.
            <br> Maximum weight of 5 kg./11.02 lb. per foot.
            <br> Halogen lights are optional.
            <br> The shelf will have as much removed from the interior to keep it light.
