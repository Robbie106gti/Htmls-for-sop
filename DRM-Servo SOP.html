            <strong>Some notes from job 3422 on SERVO DRIVE</strong>

                Order 1 connecting node per cabinet with servo drive.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use 5mm drawer bumpers (302 high drawer faces have 4 servo drive door bumpers attached) (149 high drawer faces have 2 servo
                drive door bumpers attached)
            </li>
            <li>
                Drawer depth may change from standard depending on cabinet depth when using SERVO DRIVE (servo drive adds 30mm to the slide
                depth ie 550=580 inside depth required)
