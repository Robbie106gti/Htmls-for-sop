            When a panel is finished on both faces, QC will put a Blue dot sticker on the back so all know which side is the back. The dot will be positioned near one of the back corners.

            When a 2-sided finish is applied at Nickels, there will always be an A-side and a B-side. The A-side will be inspected and will be considered as the face of the panel. The B-side will be considered the back of the panel and as such, may contain minor
            flaws. This applies to all doors, finish panels and any other 2-sided application. In the case of doors and drawer fronts, it will be obvious which is the A-side, and which is the B-side. In cases such as finish panels, where it may not be
            as obvious, Nickels will indicate which is the B-side, by applying a blue self-adhesive removable sticker.
