        <p>
            The Finishing team will receive a custom stain “match to an item or sample chunk of something” request sheet from the order
            desk.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                On a new PO, note the:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>
                        Current date.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Required date (typically 3 working days).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We will P/U (pick up).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Our custom stain number.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Order 1 liter of toner
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Order 1 liter of stain.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                Give the “item or sample chunk of something” to our purchasing team along with the yellow copy of the PO and three 6” x 10”
                blocks of the material we want stained, to be dropped off at Richelieu.
            </li>
            <li>
                Put the white copy of the PO into the purchasing office rack.
            </li>
            <li>
                Put the request sheet in the custom color request rack in the Finishing office.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pick up the custom stain when ready.
            </li>
            <li>
                When we receive the custom stain make 4 sample blocks to confirm the match.
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>
                        Throw the request sheet away.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In the custom color program, note the Toner code, Stain code and any instructions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Get 3 custom color labels from Megan for the Dealers sample blocks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Give 3 sample blocks for the dealer and, along with the original “match to item”, to shipping.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Make 1 sample block for Nickels and put it into the rack in the Finishing office with codes and instructions written on the
                        back.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            When ordering stain for a job:
        </p>
        <p>
            15 parts = 2 gallons stain and 2 gallons toner
        </p>
        <p>
            70 parts = 3 gallons stain and 3 gallons toner
