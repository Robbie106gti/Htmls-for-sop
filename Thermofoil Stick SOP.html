            An FE application is when we take melamine and laminate a sheet of thermofoil onto it.
        </p>
        <p>
            An FE takes about 30 minutes more labor to lay up the material then material for an FE in the custom line. This is because
            of the thin/fragile (marks/creases easily) material and the difficulty in handling it.

            The inconsistent surface is what it is and doesn’t add much time. A minute is spent flattening out bad spots with a hammer/back
            side of a nail set.
