                    · When Engineering is ordering doors for an order, if there is DS-DBBM required, let Harry know so he can optimize and we
                    can order the appropriate amount.

            It is an awesome product compared to the DS-DMBM.
            <br> Only our standard trimming is required (14mm) on the panel saw as opposed to 90mm off the ends for the DS-DMBM
            because the supplied sheets are in such good condition.
            <br> No knots, tear out or bad material to cut around.
            <br> It is finished better than the DS-DMBM.
            <br> It is a little softer and has a better finish when it comes in so very minimal sanding is required on the ends
            and sides.
            <br> Dennis says it is beautiful to work with and the final product looks better.
            <br> The plywood birch bottoms match perfectly to the ends and sides whereas with the DS-DMBM it was always a little
            off.
