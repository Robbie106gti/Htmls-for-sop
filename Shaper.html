        <p>
            Lock out the machine.
            <br> Lock the drive shaft.
            <br> Use the large wrenches to loosen the blade nuts.
            <br> Put in the new blade and retighten.
            <br> Put the drive shaft into neutral so the blade can spin freely and guesstimate with a sample where you want the
            height and depth adjusted to.
            <br> After the height and depth have been set, with the drive shaft still in neutral, ensure that the blade can still
            spin freely without hitting the fence etc.
            <br> Make sure the direction is correct.
            <br> Put drive shaft in gear, unlock switch, you are good to go.
