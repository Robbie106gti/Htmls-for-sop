                We recommend that you add 1” of scribe to the bottom of all Wainscot panels if trim is needed.
            </li>
            <li>
                If scribe area is wanted, there must be an attached note stating this.

                        If a 36” high Wainscot 1 was requested, an extra 1” would be added onto the bottom for scribe. They will actually receive
                        a 37” high panel and the bottom rail will be 6” high instead of 5” high.
                    </li>

                        If a 36” high Wainscot 1 with a mock kick was requested, an extra 1” would be added onto the bottom for scribe. They will
                        actually receive a 37” high panel and the mock kick area would be 1” higher (5 ½”).

                The back edges of the Rails must be broken on the inside edge of the panels.

                We will now use the same material for WS2 as we do for the PROMO-PSB (sample blocks).

                The WS2 width is 4" and the thickness is 5/16".

            <li>
                This material will become an inventory item.
