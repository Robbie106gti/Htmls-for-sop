                When a gable isn’t hinged, a spacer will not be used for the ROS.
            </li>
            <li>
                When a cabinet depth is increased beyond the depth of 24”, the depth of the ROS does not increase unless charged for and
                noted.

            ROS gable

        <ul>
            <li>
                These are used when an ROS is at the bottom of a cabinet and it isn’t the full cabinet width. A gable is then needed on one
                or both sides, and it’s used just for the ROS.
            </li>
            <li>
                When we need an ROS gable and the ROS is at the bottom of a cabinet and the gable is just for the ROS, it will be
                <strong>4” (102mm) high</strong>.

        <ul>
            <li>
                With a metabox application, ROS-MB, we’ll use 3 spacers per slide.
            </li>
            <li>
                With any of the tandem slide applications, ROS-WT, ROS-GT, ROS-ST, ROS-MT, ROS-PT, we’ll use 2 spacers per slide.
            </li>

            <u>ROS standard location: </u>
        </h6>
        <ul>
            <li>
                If 1 ROS is added in any cabinet, it is placed at the bottom of the cabinet.
            </li>
            <li>
                If more than 1 is added to a cabinet, one is at the bottom and the rest are evenly spaced in the cabinet. Any adjustable
                shelves are evenly spaced above the ROS’s.
            </li>
            <li>
                TP: If 4 ROS’s are added with no adj. shelves in the bottom section, there is 1 ROS at the bottom with 2 more ROS’s evenly
                spaced in the bottom section. 1 ROS is at the bottom of the top section.

            ROS bumper
        </h6>
        <ul>
            <li>
                These are being installed because the sharp edges on the DS-PDJBM and the DS-MDJBM are sharp and will damage the door if
                they are allowed to rub against it.
            </li>
            <li>
                Install a ROS bumper on the side, at the front, 2” up so it is just above the spacer of these ROS’s, on the hinge side only.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bumper = CP60003030 (Richelieu). See the last page for a picture of the bumper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Attach with a ¾” #6 screw.
