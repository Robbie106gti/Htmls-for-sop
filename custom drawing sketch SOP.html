            The goal behind these changes is to further reduce reworking of custom cabinets and to reduce errors.

                    Height dimensions should be per section and to the center of the dowel hole. See example. Feel free to have dimensions between
                    ROS boxes, but they still need the distance between the holes.

                    Standard measurements aren’t required. eg. If a mounting plate is in a standard position, the measurement isn’t required.

                    Dimensions will be “hook to hole” (from end of part to middle of a hole so a measuring tape can hook over the end of a part
                    before assembly).

            <li>
                <p>
                    Cabinet and shelf placement sizes will be on the left.

            <li>

                    Custom hole/item placement will be in the cabinet.

            <li>
                <p>
                    If the cabinet has more then strictly moving parts up and down, then all parts will be drawn on an individual page with holes
                    dowels and routes along with their dimensions. The individual parts should al have their own name and
                    the name should be on the drawings. eg. HFU’s will have all parts individually printed along with the
                    standard drawings.

                    These drawings will be with both shop copies directly behind the shop summary sheets before the actual shop item list.
